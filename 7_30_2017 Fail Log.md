7/30/2017 - Fail Log

- 12PM Starting exercises. Archive.org website seems to be down, cannot retrieve correspondence file
- 5PM It seems the archive.org site has come back up so I'm now continuing the exercises.
- Had a little difficult with Step One eventually came up with (.+to.+) in my expression line and ~$1 in my replace line on the regexr site.
- Stumped with Step two even entering my expression to find all lines not starting with ~ is highlighting everything except the first line. ~.+ highlights lines beginning with tilde but I cant find a way to negate this. I tried using the negative lookahead with this syntax (?! ~.+) but that didnt work either.
- I'll have to come back to this content at a later date as evidently the correct solution for step two is necessary moving forward.
